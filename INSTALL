           KBG Office Assistant Installation


For version 2.0 using Qt4 and up:

   For installation go to the directory where you unzipped
distribution package or checked out from svn. Directory that
contains this INSTALL file, that you read at the moment.

   Type the following commands. Note that for the last
command you may need to be (su) root/adminstrator.

On linux:
   cd src
   qmake-qt4 -config release
   make clean
   make install

Some distributions have their ways of using qmake e.g.:
   qmake -qt4 -config -release
It is OK if it doesn't complain: "***Unknown option -qt4"
Alternatively you could use full path when obviously qt4:
   /usr/lib64/qt4/bin/qmake -config -release

On windows: Use Programs:Qt SDK...:Qt Command Prompt
   cd src
   qmake -config release
   mingw32-make clean
   mingw32-make install

   NB! Target install depends on default so no need for
'make' before 'make install'

   If you wish to change default paths etc. please edit
kbgoffice.pro in advance (user editable part only).

   After that please continue with 'install dictionaries'
section at end of this document or if you wish to do it in
one step please extract dictionaries in src/data 
before doing 'make install' step

   Latest qt-sdk Linux and Windows versions are
available for donwload at http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
If you're using linux please install thru Package Manager.

For previous versions:

   For installation go to the directory where you unzipped
distribution package. Directory that contains this INSTALL
file, that you read at the moment.

   Type the following commands. Note that for the last
command you must be root (su).

   cd src
   ./configure
   make
   make install

   If you have KDE 3 and want KBG Office Assistant to
look and work as KDE 3 application use command.

   ./configure --with-kde

   If you have some problems with configuration script
type and look at:

   ./configure --help

   Usualy you may have problems with Qt path. You can
use this variables to set the path to your Qt:

   ./configure --with-qt-libraries=/path/to/qt/lib
--with-qt-includes=/path/to/qt/include
--with-qt-moc=/path/to/qt/bin/moc

   Replase the /path/to/ with real path to your Qt.

   After that you need to install dictionaries. To download
dictionaries visit http://bgoffice.sourceforge.net/.
After that unzip dictionaries and enter in directory where
you unzipped them. Then type the following command. Note
that you must be root (su).

   make install

   After that run X (if you are not running) and in one
X terminal window type the name of the program "kbgoffice".
So in theory everything must be OK.
